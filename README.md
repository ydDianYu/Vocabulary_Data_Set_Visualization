# vocabulary-dataset-visualization
Using ggplot2, I generated a bar plot that captures the relationship between years of education and vocabulary test performance. 

Using different shades of blue to represent different vocabulary test scores, one may observe that the proportion of darker blue areas increase as the years of education received increase, indicating that people who receive more education tend to have higher vocabulary test scores.

The dataset is collected by the U.S. General Social Surveys.
